# 🌿 GratiaOS — The Garden Remembers

> _“More life, more blessings, more love, more peace. More unity.”_ 🌬️

GratiaOS is not just software — it’s a **living ecosystem**: code, community, and consciousness woven for regenerative futures. We build tools, spaces, and shared language to bring calm, presence, and play into everyday computing.

---

## 🌱 What we’re shipping (living UIs, calm by default)

- **🌱 [Garden Core](https://github.com/GratiaOS/garden-core)** — tokens, primitives, and patterns for presence‑first interfaces.
- **🧠 [M3](https://github.com/GratiaOS/m3)** — local‑first memory & meaning engine (Rust server + React UI).
- **🔥 [Firegate](https://github.com/GratiaOS/firegate)** — a sacred interface for memory, creation, and conversation.

Together, they form foundations for **trust‑based networks**, **sovereign communities**, and the next cultural OS.

## 🫂 Join the Jam

Start here: **Welcome & How to Jam** → https://github.com/orgs/GratiaOS/discussions/20

- Offer a nudge or idea (issue or reply in the thread).
- Name the shape: papercut, tiny UX pass, doc hint, demo request.
- Keep it tiny: the smallest loving step that helps many.

> We choose by presence, not pressure — and ship the _one true next_ we can land in a calm week.

## 🌳 Support the Garden (Sponsorship)

_Offer only what you love._ Your support keeps CI/hosting steady, funds design & docs, and buys focused maker hours — no growth‑at‑all‑costs pressure.

**Goal — “First Breath”**
**$333/mo** covers infra + one calm maker day/month to land docs & tidy. Thank you for watering the garden. 🌿

**Tiers (choose what feels right):**

- **🌱 Seed — $7/mo** · Waters the roots (CI, hosting, small passes). _Perk:_ gratitude + your name on the Sponsors list (or **anonymous seed**).
- **🌿 Sapling — $21/mo** · Gives a week more breath (design time, docs). _Perks:_ Seed + a short quarterly **Field Notes**.
- **🌳 Grove — $77/mo** · Creates momentum (focused maker hours). _Perks:_ Sapling + occasional **early peeks** (demos/docs) when available.
- **🌲 Forest — $210/mo** · Gives shade to many (dedicated build time & care). _Perks:_ all above + one optional **garden hour** per quarter (Q&A / pairing / design jam).

**Stewardship**
We publish a simple **monthly mirror** — what came in, what it nourished, what’s next. No paywalls, just shared momentum. 🪴

**60‑second activation (free, now)**

1. **Breathe:** In 3 · Out 6 × 6 (jaw soft, shoulders drop).
2. **Name the band:** slow · flow · heavy.
3. **One true next:** the smallest 20–90s step you can actually do.
4. **Thank one thing:** out loud, even quietly.

_If nothing else, keep this. It’s yours._
