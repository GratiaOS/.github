# 🌿 Gratia OS — The Garden Remembers

> _“More life, more blessings, more love, more peace. More unity.”_ 🌬️

Gratia OS is not just software — it’s a **living ecosystem**.  
A constellation of code, community, and consciousness designed to support regenerative futures.  
We build tools, spaces, and shared language to weave digital infrastructure with human depth.

## 🧭 What Lives Here

This organization hosts the **core repositories** of the Gratia ecosystem:

- **🌱 [garden-core](https://github.com/GratiaOS/garden-core)** — UI primitives, design system & shared tokens
- **🔥 [m3](https://github.com/GratiaOS/m3)** — Modular server, orchestrating flows between digital & human layers
- **🌐 [firegate.space](https://github.com/GratiaOS/firegate)** — The living web portal and manifest space
- **📚 Docs & Guides** — living manuals, manifestos, and maps for explorers

Together, they form the foundation for **trust-based networks**, **sovereign communities**, and **tools for the next cultural OS**.
